Normally, I would just write it myself, but I wanted to see how ChatGPT would handle the situation. I asked:\n“Write me a polite email to my professor explaining I will miss class on Friday due to a family event.”\nThe model produced the following draft:\n\nSubject: Request to Miss Class on Friday\nDear Professor,\nI hope this message finds you well. I am writing to let you know that I will not be able to attend class on Friday due to a family event. I will make sure to catch up on the material covered. Thank you for your understanding.\nSincerely, [Your Name]\n\nI thought this was actually pretty close to what I’d send. The tone was respectful and professional, but it was also a little too generic. I edited it to include the course name and asked if there was anything I should review before the next class.\nThis showed me that while ChatGPT is a good starting point, I still need to personalize the response to sound like me.\n\n\nSome alternatives\n\n\nThe Quote\n\n\nWrite me a polite email to my professor about missing class Of course!

We often hear about people using it for essays or coding, but I think everyday uses like emailing professors are just as important.\nWhen I tested it, the response was professional and grammatically correct, but also generic. In practice, I’d use it as a template, then tweak details to make sure it sounds like me.\nThis made me think about how LLMs shape communication: they’re great at giving us a baseline of clarity and politeness, but personalization still matters — especially in academic settings where tone can affect relationships."

The first two especially caught my attention:\n\nThe Reflex Agent — basic stimulus–response behavior, like an organism pulling away from danger.\n\nThe Reinforcement Learner — creatures start remembering what worked, adjusting their behavior based on outcomes.\n\nThese sound simple, but Bennett argues that even these small steps set the stage for everything that followed — emotion, planning, and abstract thought.\n\n\nThe Prompt and Response\n\nPrompt\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n    Summarize the first part of *A Brief History of Intelligence* and explain how it connects to AI.\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\nResponse\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n    The early chapters trace how natural intelligence evolved in discrete steps — each solving a problem of survival.  \n    Reflexes led to learning, learning led to modeling the world, and eventually to planning and reasoning.  \n    Bennett’s argument suggests that modern AI mirrors this pattern: large language models are just another “layer” — machines learning by reinforcement and prediction.\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n\n\nReflection\n\nWhat I like about Bennett’s approach is how biological and computational his story feels at the same time. It makes AI feel less like magic and more like an extension of natural evolution — a continuation of the same logic that built the human brain.\nReading this, I started to think of AI as part of a long timeline, not as something new, but as a new way of organizing old ideas about intelligence.\n\n\n\n\nA Brief History of Intelligence Graphic"

    "text": "Generating Images with ChatGPT\nFor this experiment, I tested how an LLM with image-generation can create different visuals from slightly different prompts.\nPrompt A: “Generate an image of a cat sitting on a couch.”\nPrompt B: “Generate an image of a cat lounging on a couch with sunglasses.”\nThe first result was a standard realistic-looking cat image.\nThe second result added humor and personality, showing a playful cat with sunglasses.\nThis shows that small wording changes don’t just shift text output, but also the visual style of generated images. It highlights how careful prompt wording can make the difference between a generic picture and something more creative or entertaining.\n\n\n\nPrompt A: Cat sitting on a couch\n\n\n\n\n\nPrompt B: Cat lounging with sunglasses"

    "text": "Prompting\nFor my first test, I wanted to see how small changes in prompts affect how an LLM talks about sports. I used the Philadelphia Eagles as my subject.\n\nPrompt A: “Summarize the Eagles’ 2023 season in one sentence.”\n\nThe one-sentence answer gave a broad evaluation: “The Eagles had a strong season but fell short in the playoffs.”\n\nPrompt B: “Summarize the Eagles’ 2023 season in five bullet points.”\n\nThe five-bullet version highlighted key details:\n\nregular season record\nstandout players\noffensive strengths\ndefensive weaknesses\nplayoff loss\n\n\n\nObservations\nWhat stood out is that the structure of the output wasn’t just shorter or longer, the bullet-point response reorganized the story. This shows that prompt phrasing shapes how an LLM frames sports narratives, which is important if you’re using these models for sports journalism or fan engagement.\n\n\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles"

    "text": "When most people think about programming, they picture solving technical problems or shipping features. But there’s another side to coding — one that feels less like work and more like entering a state of flow. This is what I like to call vibe coding.\n\n\n\nVibe coding isn’t about deadlines, bug tickets, or sprint goals. It’s about writing code for the sake of focus, creativity, and momentum.\nIn practice, this might mean: - Putting on music that helps you focus\n- Cleaning up your environment and editor so distractions disappear\n- Building something small, experimental, or even silly — just to see where it goes\nIt’s the programming equivalent of sketching in a notebook: low-pressure, creative, and surprisingly rewarding.\n\n\n\n\nModern development is often fast-paced and outcome-driven. While productivity is important, it can also lead to burnout if every coding session is framed around efficiency. Vibe coding offers a counterbalance — a reminder that programming can be playful and exploratory.\nBenefits include: - Improved creativity: experimenting without constraints often leads to unexpected ideas.\n- Sustained motivation: coding becomes something you look forward to, not just a task list.\n- Skill growth: practice in a low-stakes environment helps sharpen intuition and technique.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to bring vibe coding into your own workflow, here are some ways to start: 1. Curate a playlist: lo-fi beats, ambient soundtracks, or anything that keeps you engaged without distraction.\n2. Set the stage: dim lights, a clear desk, maybe even a favorite drink nearby.\n3. Pick a fun project: it could be a visualization of your Spotify history, a quirky bot, or a small tool only you will ever use.\n4. Let go of outcomes: the point isn’t to finish — it’s to explore.\n\n\n\n\nCoding doesn’t always have to be serious. Sometimes the best way to unlock creativity, reduce stress, and rediscover joy in programming is to let yourself vibe with the process.\nSo next time you sit down to write code, try setting aside the pressure of productivity. Put on some music, open a blank file, and let the vibes lead you — you might be surprised by what you create."

    "text": "Prompting\nFor my first test, I wanted to see how small changes in prompts affect how an LLM talks about sports. I used the Philadelphia Eagles as my subject.\n\nPrompt A: “Summarize the Eagles’ 2023 season in one sentence.”\n\nThe one-sentence answer gave a broad evaluation: “The Eagles had a strong season but fell short in the playoffs.”\n\nPrompt B: “Summarize the Eagles’ 2023 season in five bullet points.”\n\nThe five-bullet version highlighted key details:\n\nregular season record\nstandout players\noffensive strengths\ndefensive weaknesses\nplayoff loss\n\n\n\nObservations\nWhat stood out is that the structure of the output wasn’t just shorter or longer, the bullet-point response reorganized the story. This shows that prompt phrasing shapes how an LLM frames sports narratives, which is important if you’re using these models for sports journalism or fan engagement.\n\n\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles"

Lots of half-sentences and random words. I wanted to see if GPT-5 could make them clearer, so I asked:\n“Rewrite these notes into a clean bullet point list.”\nIt worked well — the output grouped ideas into Definitions, Formulas, and Examples. It was much easier to study from than my original scribbles.\n\n\nCombination of both!\n\nPrompt\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n    Rewrite my messy class notes into a clear bullet point list\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\nResponse\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n    Sure! I’ve cleaned them up and organized them into sections.\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n\n\nReflection\n\nThis showed me how useful GPT can be for studying. It doesn’t just fix grammar — it makes notes more structured and organized. I’d still double-check details, but as a study helper it really saves time."

    "text": "Displaying LLM Outputs\n\n\nThe Copy Paste\n\n\n\n\nWriting Emails at University\n\n\nHere’s a short example of ChatGPT writing an email\n\n\nThe Email Draft\nThis week I had to email a professor about missing class for a family commitment. Normally, I would just write it myself, but I wanted to see how ChatGPT would handle the situation. I asked:\n“Write me a polite email to my professor explaining I will miss class on Friday due to a family event.”\nThe model produced the following draft:\n\nSubject: Request to Miss Class on Friday\nDear Professor,\nI hope this message finds you well. I am writing to let you know that I will not be able to attend class on Friday due to a family event. I will make sure to catch up on the material covered. Thank you for your understanding.\nSincerely, [Your Name]\n\nI thought this was actually pretty close to what I’d send. The tone was respectful and professional, but it was also a little too generic. I edited it to include the course name and asked if there was anything I should review before the next class.\nThis showed me that while ChatGPT is a good starting point, I still need to personalize the response to sound like me.\n\n\nSome alternatives\n\n\nThe Quote\n\n\nWrite me a polite email to my professor about missing class Of course! Would you like me to keep it formal, or more casual?\n\n\nChanging Background Colors\n\n\nOf course! Would you like me to keep it formal, or more casual?\n\n\nCombination of both!\n\nPrompt\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n    Write me a polite email to my professor about missing class\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\nResponse\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n    Of course! Would you like me to keep it formal, or more casual?\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n\n\nIntegrating responses\n\nThis week I wanted to explore how GPT-5 handles student communication tasks. We often hear about people using it for essays or coding, but I think everyday uses like emailing professors are just as important.\nWhen I tested it, the response was professional and grammatically correct, but also generic. In practice, I’d use it as a template, then tweak details to make sure it sounds like me.\nThis made me think about how LLMs shape communication: they’re great at giving us a baseline of clarity and politeness, but personalization still matters — especially in academic settings where tone can affect relationships."

    "text": "The Evolution of Intelligence\n\n\nThe Image\n\n\n\n\nA Brief History of Intelligence Graphic\n\n\n\nThe Copy Paste\n\nHere’s what stood out to me from the first few chapters of Max Bennett’s A Brief History of Intelligence — especially his breakdown of how intelligence evolved in stages.\n\n\nThe Early Stages\nBennett starts with a bold idea: that intelligence isn’t just something humans have — it’s something that emerged layer by layer over millions of years.\nHe introduces the five big breakthroughs in cognitive evolution. The first two especially caught my attention:\n\nThe Reflex Agent — basic stimulus–response behavior, like an organism pulling away from danger.\n\nThe Reinforcement Learner — creatures start remembering what worked, adjusting their behavior based on outcomes.\n\nThese sound simple, but Bennett argues that even these small steps set the stage for everything that followed — emotion, planning, and abstract thought.\n\n\nThe Prompt and Response\n\nPrompt\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n    Summarize the first part of *A Brief History of Intelligence* and explain how it connects to AI.\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\nResponse\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n    The early chapters trace how natural intelligence evolved in discrete steps — each solving a problem of survival.  \n    Reflexes led to learning, learning led to modeling the world, and eventually to planning and reasoning.  \n    Bennett’s argument suggests that modern AI mirrors this pattern: large language models are just another “layer” — machines learning by reinforcement and prediction.\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n\n\nReflection\n\nWhat I like about Bennett’s approach is how biological and computational his story feels at the same time. It makes AI feel less like magic and more like an extension of natural evolution — a continuation of the same logic that built the human brain.\nReading this, I started to think of AI as part of a long timeline, not as something new, but as a new way of organizing old ideas about intelligence."

    "text": "When most people think about programming, they picture solving technical problems or shipping features. But there’s another side to coding — one that feels less like work and more like entering a state of flow. This is what I like to call vibe coding.\n\n\n\nVibe coding isn’t about deadlines, bug tickets, or sprint goals. It’s about writing code for the sake of focus, creativity, and momentum.\nIn practice, this might mean: - Putting on music that helps you focus\n- Cleaning up your environment and editor so distractions disappear\n- Building something small, experimental, or even silly — just to see where it goes\nIt’s the programming equivalent of sketching in a notebook: low-pressure, creative, and surprisingly rewarding.\n\n\n\n\nModern development is often fast-paced and outcome-driven. While productivity is important, it can also lead to burnout if every coding session is framed around efficiency. Vibe coding offers a counterbalance — a reminder that programming can be playful and exploratory.\nBenefits include: - Improved creativity: experimenting without constraints often leads to unexpected ideas.\n- Sustained motivation: coding becomes something you look forward to, not just a task list.\n- Skill growth: practice in a low-stakes environment helps sharpen intuition and technique.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to bring vibe coding into your own workflow, here are some ways to start: 1. Curate a playlist: lo-fi beats, ambient soundtracks, or anything that keeps you engaged without distraction.\n2. Set the stage: dim lights, a clear desk, maybe even a favorite drink nearby.\n3. Pick a fun project: it could be a visualization of your Spotify history, a quirky bot, or a small tool only you will ever use.\n4. Let go of outcomes: the point isn’t to finish — it’s to explore.\n\n\n\n\nCoding doesn’t always have to be serious. Sometimes the best way to unlock creativity, reduce stress, and rediscover joy in programming is to let yourself vibe with the process.\nSo next time you sit down to write code, try setting aside the pressure of productivity.

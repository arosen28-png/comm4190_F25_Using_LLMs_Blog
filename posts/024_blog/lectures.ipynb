    "<p>In this post, I examined how an LLM can be used to transform dense lecture readings into accessible blog-style writing. Academic texts often contain valuable ideas, but their structure and language can make them difficult to repurpose.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Rather than summarizing mechanically, I focused on using the model to help translate academic concepts into clearer, more conversational prose while preserving the original meaning.</p>\n",

    "The author argues that media technologies shape not only how information is transmitted, but also how individuals perceive and interpret social reality over time.\n",

    "<blockquote>\n",
    "The author suggests that media doesn’t just deliver information — it actually shapes how people understand the world around them. Over time, the technologies we use influence how we interpret events, ideas, and even social relationships.\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",

    "<h1 style=\"color: #96174e\">Reflection</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This experiment showed how useful LLMs can be for bridging the gap between academic reading and public-facing writing. Instead of rewriting everything from scratch, I could use the model to help translate ideas into a different register.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>For blogging, this makes it easier to connect course material to personal reflection. The model supports clarity without replacing critical thinking.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Overall, this use case reinforced that LLMs are effective tools for adapting ideas across contexts while preserving their intellectual core.</p>\n"

    "<p>In this post, I provide an overall overview of <em>A Brief History of Intelligence</em> by Max Bennett and reflect on its central arguments and themes. Rather than focusing on any single chapter, this post synthesizes the book’s broader perspective on how intelligence emerges, evolves, and accumulates over time.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Bennett’s core contribution is reframing intelligence not as a single human trait, but as a layered process shaped by biology, culture, and technology.</p>\n",

    "<blockquote>\n",
    "Intelligence is not confined to brains alone, but distributed across systems. Cultural tools like language and writing fundamentally reshape how thinking works. Modern AI represents an extension of this historical process rather than a sudden rupture.\n",

    "<blockquote>\n",
    "Large language models can be understood as external cognitive systems that store, compress, and reorganize knowledge. Their significance lies less in mimicking human intelligence and more in how they alter the broader ecosystem of thinking.\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This framing shifts the conversation away from whether AI is “intelligent like humans” and toward how it participates in an ongoing historical pattern of cognitive augmentation.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h1 style=\"color: #96174e\">Reflection</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Reading <em>A Brief History of Intelligence</em> encouraged me to think of intelligence as something that builds slowly through layers rather than appearing fully formed. This perspective makes current debates about AI feel less unprecedented and more historically grounded.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>For understanding LLMs, Bennett’s framework is especially useful. It suggests that the most important questions are not about replacement or competition, but about integration and responsibility.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Overall, the book provides a valuable lens for situating modern AI within a much longer story of how humans extend their cognitive capacities through tools, symbols, and shared systems.</p>\n"

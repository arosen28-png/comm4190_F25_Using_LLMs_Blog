    "<p>In this post, I compared how two different large language models — GPT and Claude — handle the task of revising academic writing. Instead of asking either model to generate new content, I focused on a common student use case: improving clarity and flow in an existing paragraph.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The goal of this experiment was to see how each model balances preserving meaning with improving readability. I used the same input paragraph and the same prompt for both models.</p>\n",

    "<p>Claude’s revision was slightly shorter and more conversational. It reorganized ideas more noticeably, which made the paragraph easier to read without oversimplifying the argument.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h1 style=\"color: #96174e\">Reflection</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This comparison showed that both models are useful, but in different ways. GPT was more conservative, making minimal edits that preserved the original structure. Claude was more willing to restructure the paragraph to prioritize readability.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>For academic writing, I found Claude more helpful when clarity was the main concern, while GPT felt safer when I wanted minimal changes. This suggests that model choice matters depending on the stage of the writing process.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Overall, this experiment reinforced that LLMs work best as revision tools rather than replacements for thinking or argument development.</p>\n"

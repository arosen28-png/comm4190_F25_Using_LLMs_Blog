    "<p>In this post, I examined how an LLM can be used to surface potential counterarguments to a blog post. When writing persuasively, it is easy to overlook objections that readers might raise.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Instead of using the model to strengthen my own argument directly, I asked it to adopt a skeptical perspective and challenge the main claim.</p>\n",

    "<blockquote>\n",
    "One counterargument is that relying on LLMs may weaken a writer’s original voice and critical thinking skills over time.  \n",
    "Another concern is that without careful verification, LLM-generated suggestions could introduce inaccuracies or oversimplifications.\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The response highlighted concerns I had not fully addressed. It did not dismiss the original claim, but it exposed areas that needed clarification or qualification.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h1 style=\"color: #96174e\">Reflection</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This experiment showed that LLMs can act as productive skeptics. By articulating counterarguments, the model helped stress-test the strength of my reasoning.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>For blogging, this is useful before publishing. Anticipating objections makes arguments more balanced and credible.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Overall, this use case reinforced that LLMs can support critical thinking by challenging ideas rather than simply reinforcing them.</p>\n"

    "In *A Brief History of Intelligence*, Max Bennett continues his evolutionary map of the mind — moving from simple *reactive* intelligence to systems capable of **prediction** and **simulation**.\n",

    "If the earlier stages (Reflex Agent and Reinforcement Learner) taught organisms how to *respond* and *learn*, this next one teaches them how to **imagine**.\n",

    "### **Breakthrough #3 – The Simulating Brain**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bennett calls this the emergence of **the simulator** — a mind that can *model* the world before acting.  \n",
    "This stage appears in mammals, who evolved the ability to mentally test scenarios before committing to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The brain develops a sort of “inner movie,” replaying or forecasting outcomes.\n",
    "- Structures like the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex support this imaginative rehearsal.\n",
    "- Evolutionarily, this reduced risk — organisms could *think before they leap*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Bennett’s framing, this moment marks the dawn of **planning**, **creativity**, and **fictional thought**.  \n",
    "It’s no longer about reacting or learning from past outcomes — it’s about running experiments in the mind.\n",

    "It allows organisms to rehearse, plan, and imagine — turning experience into possibility.  \n",

    "A reinforcement learner *remembers* what worked.  \n",
    "A simulator *invents* what might work.  \n",
    "\n",
    "That shift — from repetition to imagination — feels like the essence of creativity.  \n",
    "It’s also where AI becomes eerily familiar: when a model “imagines” text, storylines, or code completions, it’s doing a faint echo of what mammals evolved millions of years ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s striking in Bennett’s account is that **imagination isn’t fluff — it’s survival.**  \n",
    "To simulate is to survive longer, to waste fewer moves, to explore the future safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading this, I started seeing GPT not as a black box, but as part of this long continuum of simulation — an artificial cousin to the same cognitive mechanism that lets us daydream, rehearse conversations, or picture tomorrow.\n",

    "<p>In this post, I examined how an LLM can be used to rewrite the same content in different tones. Tone control is especially important for blogging, since the same idea can sound academic, casual, or reflective depending on how it is written.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Rather than asking the model to create new ideas, I used an existing paragraph and tested how different prompts changed the tone while keeping the meaning consistent.</p>\n",

    "<p>In this post, I examined how an LLM can be used to identify weak or unclear parts of a blog argument. When writing, it is often difficult to notice gaps in logic or places where an idea needs more explanation.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Rather than asking the model to rewrite anything, I used it as a critical reader to point out areas that might confuse or mislead a reader.</p>\n",

    "LLMs are useful tools for bloggers because they can help improve writing quality. Many students rely on them, which shows their effectiveness and importance in academic settings.\n",

    "<p>The response highlighted exactly what was missing: specificity and support. It did not rewrite the paragraph, but it clearly pointed out what needed improvement.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "<p>This experiment showed that LLMs can function as helpful critical readers. Instead of accepting text at face value, the model flagged areas where the argument was underdeveloped.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>For blogging, this is especially useful during revision. It helps catch weak spots before publishing and encourages stronger, more precise writing.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Overall, this use case reinforced that LLMs are valuable not just for generating text, but for strengthening ideas through critique.</p>\n"

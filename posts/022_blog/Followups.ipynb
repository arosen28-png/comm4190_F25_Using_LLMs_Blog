    "<p>This experiment showed that LLMs can be useful thinking partners, not just answer generators. By helping surface better questions, the model supported deeper engagement with the topic.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>For blogging and studying, this approach encourages curiosity rather than closure. It keeps the process open-ended and exploratory.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Overall, this use case reinforced that good prompting isn’t always about getting better answers — sometimes it’s about learning how to ask better questions.</p>\n"

    "<p>In this post, I examined how an LLM can be used to analyze sports game recaps. Sports articles often focus on scores and highlights, but they can miss broader patterns or strategic takeaways.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Instead of reading multiple recaps manually, I used the model to identify recurring themes and key moments from a single game summary.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "<p>This experiment showed that LLMs can be useful tools for sports analysis, not just summarization. By focusing on patterns and turning points, the model helped extract insight from a short recap.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>For sports blogging or commentary, this approach can support deeper analysis without requiring advanced statistics.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Overall, this use case reinforced that LLMs can assist in interpreting sports narratives and identifying meaningful moments within game coverage.</p>\n"

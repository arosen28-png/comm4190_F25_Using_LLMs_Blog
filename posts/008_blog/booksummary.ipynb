    "\n",
    "Bennett starts with a bold idea: that *intelligence* isn’t just something humans have — it’s something that **emerged layer by layer** over millions of years.\n",
    "\n",
    "He introduces the **five big breakthroughs** in cognitive evolution. The first two especially caught my attention:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Reflex Agent** — basic stimulus–response behavior, like an organism pulling away from danger.  \n",
    "2. **The Reinforcement Learner** — creatures start *remembering* what worked, adjusting their behavior based on outcomes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These sound simple, but Bennett argues that even these small steps set the stage for everything that followed — emotion, planning, and abstract thought.\n",

    "    <blockquote>\n",
    "        The early chapters trace how natural intelligence evolved in discrete steps — each solving a problem of survival.  \n",
    "        Reflexes led to learning, learning led to modeling the world, and eventually to planning and reasoning.  \n",
    "        Bennett’s argument suggests that modern AI mirrors this pattern: large language models are just another “layer” — machines learning by reinforcement and prediction.\n",

    "What I like about Bennett’s approach is how **biological and computational** his story feels at the same time. It makes AI feel less like magic and more like an extension of natural evolution — a continuation of the same logic that built the human brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading this, I started to think of AI as part of a long timeline, not as something *new*, but as a **new way of organizing old ideas about intelligence**.\n",

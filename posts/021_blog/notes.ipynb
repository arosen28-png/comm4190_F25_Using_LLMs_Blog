    "LLMs can be useful writing tools, especially when creating first drafts. They work well for turning rough ideas into clearer sentences, but they still require human revision to ensure accuracy and voice. Rather than generating ideas on their own, these models are most effective when used to clarify and organize thoughts the writer already has.\n",

    "\n",
    "<p>This experiment showed how effective LLMs can be at moving from notes to prose. Instead of staring at a blank page, I could use my existing notes as input and quickly generate a usable draft.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>For blogging, this makes the transition from thinking to writing much smoother. The model helps fill in connective language while leaving the core ideas intact.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Overall, this use case reinforced that LLMs are strongest when they help expand and refine ideas rather than replace them.</p>\n"

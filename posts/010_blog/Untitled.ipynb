    "When we talk about AI “prompting,” we usually mean typing an instruction and waiting for a response.  \n",
    "But if we zoom out, prompting is something much older — it’s the art of **asking the right kind of question** to elicit intelligence, whether from humans or machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we *frame* a prompt determines not only the answer we get, but the *kind of thinking* that happens inside the system.  \n",
    "A good prompt doesn’t just extract information — it creates a **cognitive context**.\n",

    "### **Framing vs. Instructing**\n",
    "\n",
    "When we *instruct*, we tell an AI (or a person) what to do.  \n",
    "When we *frame*, we shape the space in which ideas emerge.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- “Write a poem about the ocean.” → A task.  \n",
    "- “If the ocean could speak, what would it tell the moon?” → A frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second prompt engages metaphor, perspective, and imagination.  \n",
    "It’s not longer a command — it’s a *mental environment*.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI systems, especially large language models, respond dramatically to framing.  \n",
    "They adapt tone, scope, and depth based on subtle contextual cues — mirroring how human creativity responds to open-ended or constraining situations.\n",

    "Prompt framing encourages AI to explore conceptual associations rather than literal completions.  \n",
    "By shifting tone or perspective, we engage different latent regions in the model’s memory — the linguistic equivalent of creative mood lighting.  \n",
    "This mirrors how human brainstorming works: the broader the mental space, the more novel the idea.\n",

    "</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading about prompt engineering often feels like reading a user manual.  \n",
    "But prompt *framing* feels more like reading philosophy — it’s about **how a mind is guided by questions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve noticed that when I write prompts like “explain,” I get information.  \n",
    "When I write prompts like “imagine,” I get insight.  \n",
    "It makes me think that prompting is really a mirror — showing us how we guide our *own* thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sense, good prompting isn’t about controlling AI.  \n",
    "It’s about collaborating with it — setting up conditions where both the human and the model can think more creatively.\n",

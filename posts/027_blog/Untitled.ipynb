    "<p>In this post, I examined how an LLM can be used to summarize a long blog draft into a concise overview. When posts grow longer through revision, it can become difficult to clearly articulate the main takeaway.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Rather than summarizing manually, I used the model to distill the core argument while preserving the original intent of the post.</p>\n",

    "Large language models can assist writers at multiple stages of the blogging process, from brainstorming ideas to revising drafts. However, their effectiveness depends on how intentionally they are used. Without clear goals, LLM outputs can become unfocused or overly generic, which may weaken the overall message of a post.\n",

    "In A Brief History of Intelligence, the book explains how intelligence didn’t deepen through a single breakthrough, but by adding new mental tools over time — reacting, remembering, planning, imagining.\n",
    "While reading, I started noticing how prompts can nudge AI through similar layers. Some prompts activate basic recall. Others trigger analysis or comparison. Some push toward synthesis or imagination.\n",
    "\n",
    "It made me wonder if prompts serve as small levers that move the AI between these evolutionary “stages” of thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple prompt stays at one level.\n",
    "A more open prompt moves into richer territory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tracing the Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Some prompts keep things straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Define this.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“List the main points.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Others encourage more complex thinking:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Explain how these ideas relate.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“What’s the deeper mechanism here?”\n",
    "\n",
    "And some prompts push into creative or hypothetical reasoning:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Imagine how this might have evolved differently…”\n",
    "\n",
    "“What would happen if you changed one variable…?”\n",
    "\n",
    "The book shows how intelligence developed by stacking and combining mental abilities. Prompts can guide AI through those same stacked layers.\n",

    "<div style=\"background-color: #f0f8ff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 8px;\"> <blockquote> The book’s layers — from reaction to learning to imagination — parallel the modes an AI shifts into depending on the prompt. Direct prompts lead to quick, reactive answers. Analytical prompts engage learning-like reasoning. Open-ended or creative prompts activate imaginative patterns. Just as biological intelligence expanded by adding new layers, prompting can guide an AI to use deeper or more complex reasoning. </blockquote> </div> <h1 style=\"color: #96174e\"> Reflection </h1>\n",

    "Reading the book made me realize prompting isn’t just about extracting information.\n",
    "It’s about choosing which layer of intelligence you want to tap into.\n",

    "If I ask basic questions, I get basic responses.\n",
    "If I ask layered or evolutionary questions, the AI “climbs” to those layers.\n",

    "It’s funny — exploring the evolution of intelligence is helping me evolve how I ask questions too."

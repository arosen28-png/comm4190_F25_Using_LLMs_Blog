    "<p>In this post, I explored how chaining prompts can improve the quality and specificity of images generated by an LLM. Instead of trying to get the perfect image with a single prompt, I treated image generation as an iterative process.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The goal was to see how providing follow-up instructions based on an initial output could guide the model toward a more precise and intentional result.</p>\n",

    "Generate an image of a person working on a laptop.\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The first image produced was technically correct but generic. It showed a person at a desk with a laptop, but there was little context or personality.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "<div style=\"background-color: #f8f8f8; padding: 10px; border-radius: 8px;\">\n",

    "Refine the image by placing the person in a college dorm room, working late at night with notes and books visible.\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This second prompt added more narrative detail. The resulting image included environmental cues like books, papers, and dim lighting, which made the scene feel more realistic and relatable.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "<div style=\"background-color: #f8f8f8; padding: 10px; border-radius: 8px;\">\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "Adjust the image to feel more informal and lived-in, with a messy desk and casual clothing.\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The final image felt much closer to the intended idea. Small visual details helped communicate mood and context rather than just subject matter.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h1 style=\"color: #96174e\">Reflection</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This experiment showed that image generation works best when prompts are treated as part of a sequence rather than a one-time command. Each prompt builds on the previous output and helps clarify intent.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>For blogging, this approach is especially useful because it allows visuals to align more closely with the narrative of a post. Instead of settling for a generic image, prompt chaining helps create graphics that feel intentional and relevant.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Overall, this use case reinforced that iterative prompting is just as important for images as it is for text-based LLM tasks.</p>\n"
